# FinalProject

## Discription

With our final project we created an augmented reality game called “cube game?” The objective of our augmented reality game is to navigate a cube over, around and through obstacles in order to get to the next level. The augmented reality on your phone camera is used to see around obstacles and to get a different view of the objective.
